                                        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                                        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of

                                hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                                particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                                tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                                example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
